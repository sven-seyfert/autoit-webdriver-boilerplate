## Security

This document outlines the security policy for this repository. We take security seriously and are committed to addressing any vulnerabilities that may arise.

However, in the context of AutoIt projects, it is unlikely that security vulnerabilities will be found, because the AutoIt ecosystem does not provide much tooling or other potential attack surfaces that would typically be associated with security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting

Nevertheless, if you discover a potential security issue, please report it as you would any other bug or issue.

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information on how to report issues.

### Comments on improvements

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a pull request. See also the contribution guidelines.
